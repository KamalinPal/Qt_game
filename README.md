# Qt_game

Inspired by Freebird Games, I wanted to make my own narrative-driven game.

I decided not to use any game engines, to hone my programming skills. That's why I'm only using the Qt library, which very much grew on me.

To check out a preview, you have to download the "demo" folder and run the "test.exe" in it. If I'm missing any .ddl files be sure to let me know. I tested it on few desktops but you never can be sure.
